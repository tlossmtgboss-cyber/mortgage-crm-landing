## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
Lead creation was failing because frontend form fields weren't accepted by backend.

### Solution
✅ Added 11 new fields to Lead model:
- **Property Info**: address, city, state, zip_code, property_type, property_value, down_payment
- **Financial Info**: employment_status, annual_income, monthly_debts, first_time_buyer

✅ Updated API schemas (LeadCreate, LeadResponse)  
✅ Added automatic database migrations  
✅ Deployed to production  

### Test Results
Created test lead successfully with all fields:
```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "state": "CA",
  "property_type": "Single Family",
  "credit_score": 750,
  "first_time_buyer": true
}
```
